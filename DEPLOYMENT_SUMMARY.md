- ✅ HTTPS encryption built-in
- ✅ Pay-per-use pricing (~$5-10/month for demo)
- ✅ Zero infrastructure management
- ✅ Built-in monitoring and logging

### Option 2: Local Development (Fastest for Testing)

```bash
# Quick start
./run-local.sh
```

**Access:** http://localhost:3001

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

### Frontend (AWS App Runner)
- **Runtime:** Node.js 18 on AWS App Runner
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 with production optimizations
- **Container:** Docker with Alpine Linux (lightweight)
- **SSL:** Automatic HTTPS termination
- **Scaling:** Automatic based on traffic

### Backend (Already Deployed)
- **Runtime:** Python 3.9 on AWS Lambda
- **AI Processing:** Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **API:** AWS API Gateway with CORS enabled
- **Storage:** Amazon S3 for processed results

### Architecture Benefits
- **Serverless:** Both frontend and backend scale automatically
- **Cost-Effective:** Pay only for actual usage
- **Global:** AWS global infrastructure for low latency
- **Secure:** AWS security best practices built-in

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### Local Development
- **Startup Time:** ~15 seconds
- **Response Time:** <100ms
- **Resource Usage:** Minimal (local development)

### AWS App Runner Production
- **Cold Start:** 10-30 seconds (first request)
- **Warm Response:** <500ms
- **Scaling:** Automatic 0-1000+ concurrent users
- **Availability:** 99.9% SLA

## 🔧 Environment Variables

All required environment variables are configured automatically:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT=https://6ddpddg0g3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/process
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl -I https://your-app-runner-url.amazonaws.com
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

### 2. Frontend Functionality
1. Open deployed URL in browser
2. Click "Start Camera" - should request permissions
3. Click "Test ASL" - should return "HELLO" translation
4. Test live camera feed with sign language

### 3. API Integration
```bash
curl -X POST https://6ddpddg0g3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"frame_data": "", "timestamp": "2025-06-21T12:00:00Z", "device_id": "test"}'
```
